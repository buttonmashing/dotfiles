\> spends days creating own neovim setup and memorizing key combinations \
\> refuses to use vim under any circumstances

Just repurposing an old sandy bridge laptop and staying minimal. \
There's a general lack of compositing since i'm mostly just rdp-ing to use it, and the poor 2011 intel igpu barely keeps up as is.
# todo:
- figure out how to read neovim docs
  - make a better file structure for neovim, not all in a single file bruh
- make a list of my useful installed packages like z, tmux, starship, etc (should have used nixos xd)
- stop editing the default config files in `/etc` like an ape
- symlinking config
